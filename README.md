# Competitive Programming For Beginners

Welcome! This is a site maintained by [Nitya](https://github.com/nitya) (tech professional) and [AJ](https://github.com/ajcreates) (high-school student) to document our learning journey into _competitive programming_ (CP) - with an initial focus on the [USA Computing Olympiad (USACO)](http://www.usaco.org/index.php) competition. Hello world!

## About CP

[Competitive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)
is a code-driven competition where participants are given a set of challenges and specifications - and must solve those problems with code that meets constraints in speed (fast execution) and size (code footprint).

## About USACO
[USA Computing Olympiad (USACO)](http://www.usaco.org/index.php) is a competitive programming event for _high school students_. The USACO organization is a non-profit with the mission of motivating and training high-school computing students with:
 - training resources (free)
 - programming contests (online)
 - training camp (summer, invitation only)
 - opportunity for top 4 students each year to represent USA in the International Olympiad in Informations (IOI).

## About Requirements

The current USACO competitions require solutions to be written in one of three supported languages: `C++`, `Python` or `Java` - which aligns with the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) in popular adoption rankings.

Code needs to optimize for _running time_ and _code size_, which can create added challenges based on selected language.
 - C++ is best from speed/size perspective, but is more complex to learn and debug for new programmers.
 - Python is the easiest to learn but may not always allow solutions that fit the time or size constraints.
 - Java is a good middle ground with moderate performance and ease of use, making it a good starting point for first-time competitive programmers.

An additional incentive for _Java_ is that it is seen as a valued skill for professional developers in enterprise and consumer domains.

> Decision: We'll be using Java.

## Objectives

* **Setup** - local development environment for competitive programming.
* **Learn** - Java programming from free, online resources.
* **Practice** -  for USACO using resources from [USACO guide](https://usaco.guide) and [USACO org](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=resources)
* **Document** - our learning journey online, as a useful roadmap for others.
* **Share** - relevant resources or communities that were useful in helping us progress.
